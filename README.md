# EstudosAcessibilidade
My final project for the Acessibility courses in Alura's Front-end formation.

The base code for this project was already given, and I used HTML, CSS and some Javascript to make the website more acessible to partialy or completeley deaf and blind people. Some adjustements made are destined to make it easier to navigate with screen readers while others are destined to facilitate voice understanding, like subtitles to the institutional video.

To use this material all you need is an internet browser and any kind of text editor.
